=============================================================

Introduction
------------

``pyisbn`` is a `GPL v3`_ licensed module for working with various book
identification numbers.  It includes functions for conversion, verification and
generation of checksums.  It also includes basic classes for representing ISBNs
as objects.

See the ``doc`` directory for installation instructions and usage information,
you can also `view the content online`_.

Requirements
------------

``pyisbn`` does not depend on any modules that aren’t included in Python_’s
standard library, and as such should run with Python 2.4 or newer(including
Python 3) [#]_.  If ``pyisbn`` doesn’t work with the version of Python you have
installed, open an issue_ and I’ll endeavour to fix it.

The module have been tested on many UNIX-like systems, including Linux and OS X,
but it should work fine on other systems too.

.. [#] The module may work with older Python versions, but it has only been
       tested with v2.4 and above.

Example
-------

The simplest way to show how ``pyisbn`` works is by example, and here goes::

    >>> import pyisbn
    >>> Permutation_City = "1-85798-218-5"
    >>> pyisbn.validate(Permutation_City)
    True
    >>> pyisbn.convert(Permutation_City)
    '9781857982183'

or using the object pattern use::

    >>> Permutation_City = pyisbn.Isbn10("1-85798-218-5")
    >>> Permutation_City.validate()
    True
    >>> Permutation_City.convert()
    '9781857982183'
    >>> print(Permutation_City)
    ISBN 1-85798-218-5

All independent functions and classes contain (hopefully) useful docstrings.

API Stability
-------------

Now that ``pyisbn`` 1.0 has been released the API will is frozen, and any
changes which aren’t backwards compatible will force a major version bump.
