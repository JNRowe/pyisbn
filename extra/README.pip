The requirements files in this directory are somewhat untested, as I have no
systems with packages managed via ``pip``.

While I go to some effort to run some automated installation tests with ``pip``,
there may be problems that I'm not seeing through limited use.  If you find
one/some please report them!

The same holds true for direct installation via ``setup.py``, if you use it and
spot a bug please report it!
