``pyisbn``
==========

A module for working with 10- and 13-digit ISBNs
------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

``pyisbn`` is a GPL v2 licensed module for working with various book
identification numbers.  It includes functions for conversion,
verification and generation of checksums

Requirements
------------

``pyisbn`` does not depend on any modules that aren't included in
Python_'s standard library, and as such should run with Python 2.5 or
newer [#]_.  If ``pyisbn`` doesn't work with the version of Python you
have installed, drop me a mail_ and I'll endeavour to fix it.

The module have been tested on many UNIX-like systems, including Linux,
Solaris and OS X, but it should work fine on other systems too.  The
module contains a large collection of ``doctest`` tests that will be run
if executed directly or with Python's ``-m`` switch.  You can also run
the testsuite by executing ``make check`` in the source tree.

.. [#] The module may work with older Python versions, but it has only
       been tested with v2.5.

Example
-------

The simplest way to show how ``pyisbn`` works is by example, and here
goes::

    >>> import ISBN
    >>> Permutation_City = "1-85798-218-5"
    >>> ISBN.validate(Permutation_City)
    True
    >>> ISBN.convert(Permutation_City)
    9781857982183

All independent functions contain hopefully useful docstrings with
``doctest``-based examples.  The ``html/`` directory contains the
preprocessed epydoc_ output for reference.

Bugs
----

If you find a bug don't hesitate to drop me a mail_ preferably including
a minimal testcase, or even better a patch!
